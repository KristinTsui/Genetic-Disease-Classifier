Genetic disease classfication in pediatric patients
Train and compare different machine learning algorithms to identify genetic disease using a medical dataset.

Background: 
Genetic diseases are caused by mutations in the DNA
Some genetic conditions are severe and has serious health implications. E.g., Leigh syndrome 
These mutations can be passed on from parents to child
Genetic testing is crucial for early intervention

Research question: Can machine learning algorithms predict the type of genetic disorder in a patient using a medical dataset?
