Genetic disease classfication in pediatric patients.

Train and compare different machine learning algorithms to identify genetic disease using a medical dataset.

Background: 
Genetic diseases are caused by mutations in the DNA. These mutations can be passed on from parent to child.
Some genetic conditions are severe and has serious health implications, with no cure. E.g., Leigh syndrome 
Hence, genetic testing is crucial to preventing occurence of these disorders.

Research question: Can machine learning algorithms predict the type of genetic disorder in a patient using a medical dataset?
